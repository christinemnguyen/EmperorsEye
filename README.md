# EmperorsEye
CMPE 130 Project

For this Project, the Emperor's Eye, our goal was to create a program that would add onto the Contact list from our phones. This addon includes the person's address and the shortest distance from their house to yours. 

Our project is still unfinished. We have not been able to combine the 2 individual working codes together to work cohesively. 
We currently have implemented the Dijkstra's Algorithm for the shortest distance with a predetermined graph and an address book that allows users to add, search, and delete users. Adding users would include having them enter their addresses as well.
